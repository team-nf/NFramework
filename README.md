## Installation

Add the library by adding these lines in your `build.gradle` file:

```Gradle
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.team-nf:NFramework:<release>'
}
```

We use [JitPack](https://jitpack.io) as a Gradle/Maven repository. This means that if you add the project using Gradle it will be automatically updated with the latest changes to the `master` branch, as well as source code and documentation .jar files.
